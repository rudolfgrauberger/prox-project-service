# PTB Project Service
The purpose of this service is to provide a backend for projects of the "Projekt- und Themenbörse (PTB)" web application of TH Köln.

## Installation
```
mvn clean install
```
Executes the [Maven default lifecycle](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html) up to the install phase. During package phase a runnable JAR is created and during install phase a docker image is build.

## Usage
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-project-service.yml up
```
Starts a Docker container based on the compose file and the image. A Docker network named `ptb` is required for the communication between services:
```
docker network create ptb
```
It is also possible to run the JAR directly with specific Spring profiles:
```
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=local target/project-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
